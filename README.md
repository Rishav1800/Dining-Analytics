# Dining Analytics: Unveiling the Secrets of a Japanese Restaurant Startup

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of a restaurant sales data. 

In the early months of 2021, a restaurant with a deep love for Japanese cuisine decided to venture into the restaurant business. This ambitious entrepreneur aimed to create a cozy eatery specializing in three beloved Japanese dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen.

The restaurant had gathered some fundamental information, the owners were unsure how to effectively utilize this data to enhance their business operations and ensure its sustainability.

### Objective

The restaurant wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their

* visiting patterns,
* how much money theyâ€™ve spent, and
* which menu items are their favourite.

Having this deeper connection with their customers will help them deliver a better and more personalised experience for their loyal customers.

### Data

The restaurant has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:

* sales
* menu
* members
